//With Mongoose, you can prevent duplicates in your databases using validation. Validation is defined in the SchemaType and is a middleware.
// You can also create your own validation in the schema or you can use Mongoosesâ€™s built in validation. To prevent duplicates, we r
//ecommend using the unique property as it tells Mongoose each document should have a unique value for a given path. It is a shorthand 
//for creating a MongoDB unique index on, in this case, email.
//mongoose-unique-validator is a plugin which adds pre-save validation for unique fields within a Mongoose schema.
